# University Dining

This program recreates a cafeteria. People are divided into different tastes at the entrance. They then pick a suitable food and dessert outlet and pay for their goods at the checkout before walking into the canteen. Afterward, they must hand in their dishes in the queue and leave the building.

In this example, we look at how long people must wait for food and how this relates to their food choice. In addition, we evaluate the workload of the counters and the staff. Data on the queue and the workload of the dining room are also collected.

### Package Abstraction

The dining simulation and design can be abstracked using packages. Here, goods are checked out differently, have to be stored for a specific time, will be pulled out of the warehouse, and can be sent to the output with a queue.

The packages are checked for their average waiting times and how many people are waiting for the classifications, how busy the conveyor belts, workers, and queues are, and how much is currently in the warehouse.
