MA Supply Chain Management Course from the University of Applied Science Mittweida that took place in 2021.

> **_NOTE:_** The 3D model names within simulations appear in German

## Course Contents

This course delved into the fundamentals of supply chain management, exploring key concepts and advanced planning techniques. It commenced with an introduction to supply chain management, discussing value creation and the SCOR Model. Advanced planning and scheduling, a critical aspect of supply chain management, were thoroughly examined, highlighting the complexities and evolutionary methods.

It also provided insights into operation theory, including random numbers, the Monte Carlo Method, stochastic processes, and Markov chains. The course explored the application of Petri nets in modeling and analyzing supply chain systems.

### Features

- Exploration of supply chain management principles
- In-depth understanding of advanced planning and scheduling techniques
- Hands-on learning of operation theory and optimization methods
- Practical application of supply chain analysis and optimization

## Repository Contents

The practical side of the course focused on building simulations and operation theories for supply chain management use cases. It features an immersive introduction to simulation software and possibilities and includes a broad set of libraries and functions to monitor such simulation projects.
