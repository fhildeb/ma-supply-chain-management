# Warehouse Coordination

This simulation is an production model that A production model classifies incoming goods into different parts using various random methods and sends them to separate machines if they are not already working to capacity. The goods are temporarily stored until they are checked for quality by a control authority and sent to the goods issue department.

However, it does not automatically deliver products to the machines. Yet, it implements an information center that two operators can read. The operators have precise work paths which they can follow and transport the raw materials and finished products back and forth between the receiving area, the machine, the control station, and the warehouse. When transporting the goods from the final pickup point to the warehouse, another information center is used, which is read by forklift drivers. They efficiently transport a load of finished products to the warehouse.

The project includes evaluations regarding machine utilization, workers, and average waiting times between all the manufacturing processes.
