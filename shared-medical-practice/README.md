# Shared Medical Practice

This simulation deals with waiting and treatment in a doctor's office. People have to register at the reception, are assigned to a group and the appropriate doctor according to their symptoms, and are then taken to the continuing waiting room until the doctor's room becomes free. After a varying treatment time, people arrive at a standard exit.
