# Post Office

This simulation project recreates a post office in which only a certain number of people are allowed to be in the waiting area and are then forwarded to different offices. There are three different office types in different quantities. Customers can either come through the office or are sent away again when the workload is high.

Different post offices have different processing times. Customer satisfaction and average waiting time are measured throughout the process. If customers wait longer, satisfaction declines. Workloads and waiting time forecasts are also made.
