# Simulation Training

This training session focused on building an advanced process manufacturing installation based on the [FlexSim Training Course](https://youtu.be/dLj4BG_Di1w)

## Process

The model includes a package delivery system, a separator, and a queuing mechanism for efficient dispatching to operators. As operators process incoming items, they are checked for rework requirements and either re-enter production or are stored in the warehouse. The operator manufactures various product types.Once adequate supplies of the different product types are ready, the final product is assembled and transported via roller conveyor.

## Analytics

The simulation continuously analyzes machine statuses, transport utilities' occupation and usage time, and key performance indicators such as throughput, content, and staytime for each part type. By evaluating this data, the model aims to enhance overall efficiency and productivity in the supply chain.

## Project Steps

The project is divided into multiple interconnected stages. Each stage will build on the previous one, focusing on specific aspects of the production and logistics process to optimize efficiency and productivity.
